## Basic Background

**Spring** is a popular framework for building java applications. It provides us with multiple helper classes and annotations.

However, there is an issue with Spring that it is too complex to setup a project in it. This is where **Spring Boot** is useful. It eases the initial configuration before Spring development. It minimizes the amount of manual configuration required and also performs auto-configuration based on props file and JAR classpath. It helps to resolve dependency conflicts (such as Maven or Gradle) and provides an embedded HTTP server that supports Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow, etc.

We can think of Spring Boot as a simplification layer above Spring. It still uses Spring behind the scenes.
